Safety and Security are absolutely critical to a blockchain's usability given the amount of money and information currently stored in web3. 

For developers, readable code can drastically cut down on programming time, as well as help with developer collaborations or fixing bugs. 

There are an increasing amount of new blockchains with new languages, making the learning curve quite difficult if one doesn't possess any previous knowledge. Blockchains with a lower barrier to entry (or those that have similar language fundatamentals) will likely succeed as they will expedite the time it takes for developers to adapt and learn. 

Creating an environment where the developer (or aspring developer) feels comfortable debugging code will greatly increase the chances for a higher adoption rate of developers.
