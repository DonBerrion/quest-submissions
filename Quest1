The blockchain is an open-source public database run by a decentralized network of computer nodes. 
Unlike traditional databases, the blockchain stores/groups information in 'blocks', which are encrypted and immutable. 

Smart contracts are programs based on a set of rules, which are stored on the blockchain. 
Smart contracts allow anyone to interact with them in order execute functions/actions given specific rules are met.  

Transactions are able to change data on the blockchain, as opposed to scripts which can read data on the blockchain. 
Transactions typically cost gas fees. Scripts are entirely free.
